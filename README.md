# Getting Started with the EWS Managed API

The Exchange Web Services (EWS) Managed API provides a managed interface for developing .NET client applications that use EWS.
By using the EWS Managed API, you can access almost all the information stored in an Office 365, Exchange Online, or Exchange Server mailbox.

## Download options

The EWS Managed API is available as an open-source project on GitHub, or as a Microsoft Windows Installer on the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=255472). 
The project available on GitHub is based on the EWS Managed API 2.3, and includes any additional improvements since then.

## Documentation

Documentation for the EWS Managed API is available in the [MSDN Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms123401.aspx).
In addition to the getting started links provided, MSDN has how to topics and code samples for the most frequently used EWS Managed API objects in the [Develop](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj900166(v=exchg.150).aspx) node. All the latest information about the EWS Managed API, EWS, and related web services can be found under the [Explore the EWS Managed API, EWS, and web services in Exchange](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj536567(v=exchg.150).aspx) topic on MSDN.

## Prerequisites

- A C# compiler to build the DLL files. We recommend Visual Studio 2013.
- A mailbox on Office 365 or an Exchange server that is running Exchange Online or a version of Exchange starting with Exchange Server 2007.
- A version of the .NET Framework starting with the .NET Framework 3.5.
