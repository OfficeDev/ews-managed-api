The Exchange Web Services (EWS) Managed API provides a managed interface for developing .NET client applications that use EWS.
By using the EWS Managed API, you can access almost all the information stored in an Office 365, Exchange Online, or Exchange Server mailbox.

## Download options

Download EWS Managed API via [nuget](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices/).

Documentation for the EWS Managed API is available in the [Web services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dd877012(v=exchg.150).aspx) node of the [MSDN Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms123401.aspx).
In addition to the getting started links provided, you can find how to topics and code samples for the most frequently used EWS Managed API objects in the [Develop](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj900166(v=exchg.150).aspx) node. All the latest information about the EWS Managed API, EWS, and related web services can be found under the [Explore the EWS Managed API, EWS, and web services in Exchange](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj536567(v=exchg.150).aspx) topic on MSDN.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to work with the EWS Managed API:
- A C# compiler to build the DLL files. We recommend Visual Studio 2013.
- A mailbox on Office 365 or an Exchange server that is running Exchange Online or a version of Exchange starting with Exchange Server 2007.
- A version of the .NET Framework starting with the .NET Framework 3.5.
